actually integer and string comparison this condition we have use single and double collans 
#! /bin/bash

count=10

if [ $count -eq 9 ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
 rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


#! /bin/bash

count=10

if [ $count -ne 9 ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


#! /bin/bash

count=10

if [ $count -gt 9 ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


! /bin/bash

count=10

if [ $count > 9 ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true
 
 
 same with double collan
 #! /bin/bash

count=10

if (($count > 9))
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


#! /bin/bash

count=10

if (($count >= 9))
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi 
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true
  
  
  now comparing strings
  #! /bin/bash

word=abc

if [ $word == "abc" ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


#! /bin/bash

word=abc

if [ $word = "abc" ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


#! /bin/bash

word=abc

if [ $word  != "abccc" ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  ake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true

#! /bin/bash

word=a

if [ $word  < "b" ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
./hello.sh: line 5: b: No such file or directory

if have to use double conditin to satisfy the condition
#! /bin/bash

word=a

if [[ $word  < "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  fi  
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true


now its else condition
#! /bin/bash

word=a

if [[ $word  == "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
  else
  echo "condition is false"
  fi 
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is false


now its if else condition
#! /bin/bash

word=a

if [[ $word  == "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
 elif [[$word == "a" ]] 
 then
 echo "condition is true" 
  else
  echo "condition is false"
  fi 
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
./hello.sh: line 8: [[a: command not found
condition is false
 its showing false condition because 8th line brakets are close to near to dollar symbol so its showing false we have to check and correct it then execute
 writtten again down line in correct manner
 
 #! /bin/bash

word=a

if [[ $word  == "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
 elif [[ $word == "a" ]] 
 then
 echo "condition is true" 
  else
  echo "condition is false"
  fi 
  
  rake@rake-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh
condition is true
